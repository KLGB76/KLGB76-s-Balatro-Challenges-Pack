# KLGB76's Balatro Challenges Pack

This mod adds a total of 20 Challenges and 7 Boss Blinds, imagined by KLGB76, to the game.

You'll need [KLGB76's Joker Pack﻿](https://github.com/KLGB76/KLGB76-s-Balatro-Joker-Pack), as well as [Challenger Deep﻿](https://github.com/OOkayOak/Challenger-Deep) to play all the challenges.

The challenges vary greatly in difficulty and theming. List of challenges:

- Leaves and Vines
- On The Edge
- Shine Bright like a Diamond
- BANANAS!!!
- I see you
- Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Challenge Deck
- Money Manager

- What have you done?!
- Which came first?
- Collect them all
- Obscured
- 3 Dices, 1 Dream (v1.5.0 and above)

The bosses are themed around weapons. List of boss blinds:

- The Axe
- The Guillotine
- The Scythe
- The Whip
- The Spear
- The Knuckle
- The Nuke (based of an idea by Scyhigh, made possible thanks to the help of Dilly_The_Dillster)

Changelog(s):

- v1.1.0: Fixed interaction between debuffing Boss Blinds and Rank-Changing Consumables

Known Bug(s):
- Joker still appears in BANANAS!!! (probably fail-safe if uncommon Jokers are supposed to spawn)
- The sound of cards being destroyed by Guillotine/Scythe plays twice
